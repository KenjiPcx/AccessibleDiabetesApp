# Solution identification
## Here are some of the solutions we identified in month 2: 

* We started with Azure Machine Learning (ML) since it can be used to fine-tune the predicted glucose levels for individual users and retrain the model periodically with user data. This can help improve the accuracy of the predictions and make the insulin delivery plan more personalized and effective.

* Then we proceeded to research Azure Computer Vision. It can be used to identify the types of carbohydrates in food pictures, which can be useful for carb planning.

* In order to store commonly used recipes Azure Databases could be choosen toghether with Azure Bots, that can be used to interact with the app and provide summaries and other information to users.

Other options we could have implemented if there was the time were: 

* Azure Maps can also be integrated into the app to remind users to record their carbohydrate intake and provide other helpful reminders, 
such as when they are in a gym or other location where they may be more likely to need to manage their diabetes.

* Finally, an Azure IoT interface can be added to connect the app to continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, allowing for even more accurate
and personalized management of diabetes.
