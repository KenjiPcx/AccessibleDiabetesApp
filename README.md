## Team Name: DiaBot
## Team Member: Kenji Phang, Javeria Ehsan, Maryem Benali,  Eleonora Criscione
## Project type : Prototype Sprint - Healthcare
purpose & description : Setup an experience prototype, based on azure & cognitive services. Prototyping is the process of creating a model or early version of a product in order to test its functionality and feasibility. The process of prototyping typically will be developed in five main stages:
1.Defining the vision: creating an overarching vision for the product and answering key questions such as what problem it solves, who the target market is, and what the anticipated price point will be. This helps determine if it is viable and if the cost of creating a prototype is justified.
2. Focusing on key features: rather than trying to make the prototype identical to the final product, we should focus on one or two key features to test in the prototype. This helps keep the prototype simple and avoids wasting time on unnecessary details.
Production
3. Testing and refining: after the initial prototype is created, it should be tested and evaluated to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
4. Presentation: The final stage of the prototyping process is presenting the prototype this helps gauge interest in the product and provides feedback that can be used to refine the design.

The whole goal of this project is to try building with Azure and .NET, and expose myself to as many technologies/services as possible, so this project is going to use a lot of overengineered services that wouldn't make sense to use in a real application.
