# AccessibleDiabetesApp

## What is this project about?
This is my project for the Microsoft Student Ambassadors Q3 Social Impact Project.

I was placed in a medtech project and I ended up going with an idea to implement a diabetes management app based on the Loop app, but using Azure tools and with extra accessibility features focusing on using intelligent bots to interct with the application.

Since I lack an original idea, the whole goal of this project is to try building with Azure and .NET, and expose myself to as many technologies/services as possible, so this project is going to use a lot of overengineered services that wouldn't make sense to use in a real application. 

## Technologies used
- .NET Core WebApp 
- .NET Maui
- Azure SignalR Service
- Azure Mobile Apps Service
- Azure Bot Service
- Azure Cognitive Service, LUIS
- Azure Speech
